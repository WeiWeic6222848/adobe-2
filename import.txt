There are two flows to import

```SaveSignedCopies``` and `SendToBoss`

To import these flows, login to your power automate account first, then go to `My Flow` and select `import` on the top-right corner

You will need to create 3 folders in your one drive which corresponds to: `ready`,`sent` and `approved` folder mentioned in the readme


##SendToBoss    

This flow requires 3 connections:

`one drive` and `adobe sign` and `adobe pdf tools`

You need to login to one drive and adobe sign and give consent for the flow to access them.

for adobe pdf tools, you need to provide your client secret, and private keys and other stuff which should be provided when you have signed up for adobe pdf tools.

After the connection has been established, you need to change the folders and boss email at the start of the flow to the folders in your one drive.

an example of the import and login process and folder selection can be seen in the demo video.
